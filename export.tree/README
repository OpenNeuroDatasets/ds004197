Overview:
The dataset involves a study for inner speech detection using bimodal electroencephalography (EEG) and Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (FMRI). The dataset consits of 1280 trials from 4 adult healthy subjects (2 male + 2 female) for each modality.
The dataset consits of 1280 trials in each modality (EEG + FMRI). The stimulus consists of 4 words from 2 categories:
1. Social: child, daughter, father, wife
2. Numeric: four, three, ten, six

There are four subjects sub01, sub02, sub03, sub05 files. Intitially there were 5 participants, however sub04 data 
was rejected due to high gluctuations. Details of valid data are available at participants.tsv file.

Experimental paradigm:
To Do

EEG DATA:
RAW EEG Data 
Device: BioSemi Active2
EEG data was sampled 

FMRI DATA:

All the data was acquired via SIEMENS MAGNETOM Prisma
All DICOM files were converted to NFTII using MRIcroGL 1.2.20211006 x86-64 FPC which uses dcm2niix for the conversion.
FMRI task event file for each subject session conatins the following columns
Innerword - Can be any of the 8 words child, daughter, father, wife, four, three, ten, six
Condition - Can be Social or Numeric
Stimulus Onset time in Seconds
Stimulus Offset time in Seconds

Task Events are available in subX_seesionY.tsv where X stands for subject number 1,2,3 and 5 and Y stands for session number 1 or 2.

For FMRI BOLD files the following parameters were used.
Slices:68
TR:2160 ms
TE:30.00 ms

For FMRI field maps GRE Field maps:
TR: 662.0 ms
TE1: 4.92ms
TE2: 7.38ms
